Lagos de Covadronga / Lakes of Covadronga
=========================================

22km climb in Northern Spain. Real Life Video RLV Format

Basically the same as Alpe dHuez. Very similar stats on length, height gain and gradients (if anything, Covadonga is slightly steeper), but far less hairpiny. Its also lower altitude because its near the coast. You can ride up it in the morning, have a wander round some stunning scenery, then back down to the beach for the afternoon. The roads into the Picos de Europa are not mountain passes. They dont go up one side and down the other; they kind of point inwards towards the centre of the national park and peter out. And they werent laid to get coaches to a ski resort either, because there isnt one (although there is/was a cable car on the south side of the national park at Funte De). So they feel like country lanes, rather than the motorways that go over a lot of mountain passes.

The Lagos de Covadonga is situated in Asturias. This climb belongs to the Picos de Europa and Cantabrian Mountains. The Lagos de Covadonga via Soto de Cangas is ranked number 20 of the Picos de Europa and Cantabrian Mountains.
